KEYSOUND					*keysound*

KeySound adds typewriter sounds to Vim in |Insert-mode|. It requires Vim 9.0
or later compiled with |+sound|.

						*:KeySoundDebug*
:KeySoundDebug		Print debugging information in a dialog.

						*:KeySoundOff*
:KeySoundOff		Turn off typewriter sounds.

						*:KeySoundOn*
:KeySoundOn		Activate typewriter sounds.

						*:KeySoundToggle*
:KeySoundToggle		Toggle typewriter sounds.

By default, KeySound plays a sound for each key triggered by |InsertCharPre|.
It also plays a "carriage return" sound when pressing |<Enter>|.

						*g:keysound*
A |dict| to configure which sounds should be played for each key press. This
is the default configuration:
>
	g:keysound = {
	  'default': [
	    'freesound/1.wav',
	    'freesound/2.wav',
	    'freesound/3.wav'
	  ],
	  "\<cr>": ['freesound/carriage1.wav'],
	}
<
Users may define `g:keysound` in their |vimrc| to extend or override the
default configuration. The dictionary maps keys or events to lists of sound
files. The special `'default'` entry is used for keys that are not explicitly
defined in `g:keysound`. Keys may also be the names of |autocmd-events|.

When a key or event is associated with more than one sound, a sound is chosen
randomly each time that key is pressed or that event is triggered. To suppress
a sound for a specific key, map it to an empty list or use |null_string| or an
empty string. For example:
>
	g:keysound = {
	    "\<bs>":       ['daktilo/kick.mp3'],
	    'f':           ['daktilo/keystroke.mp3'],
	    'q':           ['daktilo/keydown.mp3', 'daktilo/keyup.mp3', ''],
	    'j':           [],
	    'k':           [null_string],
	    'default':     ['daktilo/keydown.mp3'],
            'InsertLeave': ['freesound/ding1.wav'],
	}
<
With the configuration above:

- pressing Backspace will play `kick.mp3`;
- pressing `f` will play `keystroke.mp3`;
- pressing `q` will randomly play one of `keydown.mp3` or `keyup.mp3` or no
  sound.
- pressing `j` will not play any sound;
- pressing `k` will also not play any sound;
- any other key triggering |InsertCharPre| will play `keydown.mp3`;
- pressing Enter will play the default sound for carriage return (see the
  default configuration);
- the remaining keys will not play any sound;
- finally, `ding1.wav` will be played each time Insert mode is exited.

Keys that do not trigger |InsertCharPre|, such as |<Enter>|, |backspace|,
etc., must not be mapped for KeySound to be able to configure them (see
|key-mapping|), because KeySound will need to map those keys. If a mapping
already exists, KeySound will not overwrite it: you will need to set up the
mappings yourself.

The available sound files are located inside the `sounds` folder of the
plugin. You may add your own sounds there. The supported formats vary with the
platform, but at least `.wav` and `.mp3` files should work.

						*g:keysound_throttle*
Maximum number of simultaneous sounds to play. When typing fast and this
threshold is exceeded, sounds are skipped for additional key presses long as
the number of simultaneously playing sounds is higher that the threshold. The
threshold must be a positive value.
>
	g:keysound_throttle = 20
